**When you think about authentication the first thing that comes to mind is most likely a user to machine authentication, like logging into a social media or banking app.**

But there is another case where machines need to exchange data between each other in what is aptly called **machine to machine (M2M) communication**.

Let's enter the world of machines. 🤖

## What is Machine to Machine Communication? 
**The automated exchange of information between devices or machines.**

Applications and services often need to communicate without direct human involvement. This is what is known as **machine-to-machine (M2M) communication**, where "machines" can refer to servers, applications, Internet of Things devices, or APIs.

### Examples of M2M communication: 
- ☁️ A cloud service retrieving data from a database
- 🔄 An API fetching information from another service 
- 📡 Two IoT (Internet of Things) devices synchronizing their status

Unlike human-to-machine communication *(like logging into a website with a username and password)* where the identity of the human needs to be verified, **M2M communication requires authentication mechanisms that verify the identity of a machine.** 


## What is Machine-to-Machine Authentication?

M2M authentication verifies machine identities to enable secure data exchange. 
M2M uses protocols like OAuth 2.0 for robust security measures. 
M2M is essential for IoT (Internet of Things) devices and automated business processes.

It's the process of verifying digital identities between devices or systems without human intervention. *[this line could come first because it explains what it is quickly. Could add as opposed to what, to give a better example and overview.]*

This is super important for automated actions where systems need to authenticate requests or actions to make sure that the data exchange still remains secure even if the systems is automated. 

It requires robust security to ensure the data integrity and privacy. 

Machine-to-machine authentication is the process that allows one system to verify the identity of another system before sharing data. This can be done using various methods, like API keys, OAuth tokens, mutual TLS (mTLS), or cryptographic certificates. Strong M2M authentication prevents unauthorized access, protects sensitive data, and ensures that only trusted entities can interact within a network. 

## Deeper Look Into How M2M Authentication Works

1. Devices exchange data without human interaction or oversight. 
2. Devices authenticate by presenting their unique Client ID and Secret to an OAUth 2.0 Authorization server. 
3. Post-authentication, devices receive an Access Token that grants them the necessary permissions to perform specific tasks or access certain resources. 
4. Ensure that only authenticated devices can initiate communication, enhancing the security of data transfers. 
5. M2M utilizes standards like MQTT, CoAP, and more to fit specific needs of device communication and scalability. 
6. Prevents unauthorized access and ensures that data exchanges between machines are secure. 
7. Facilitates communication in large-scale systems such as IoT (Internet of Things) and cloud infrastructures without compromising security. 
8. Allows machines to perform tasks autonomously, reducing the need for human intervention and increasing operational efficiency. 

## Common Use Cases for M2M Authentication 

In this section we will take a look at common scenarios where M2M authentication makes sense. 

### Service to Service 

### Daemon to Backend 

### CLI client to Internal Service 

### Internet of Things tools 

## Benefits of Using M2M Authentication 
- Increased Efficiency 
- Cost Savings 
- Improved Safety
