## Introduction to Identity and Access Management üîê

**Identity and Access Management (IAM)** is a framework of tools, policies, and processes that ensures the right people have access to the right resources at the right time ‚Äî and that unauthorized users are kept out.

At its core, IAM is about managing digital identities and controlling who can do what within your systems and data. It covers everything from confirming a user's identity (**authentication**) to determining their permissions (**authorization**).

### Key Components of IAM ‚öôÔ∏è
IAM is built on several core components that work together to manage identities and control access:
- üîë **Authentication:** Verifies a user's identity using by credentials like passwords, biometrics, or MFA.
- üõÇ **Authorization:** Determines what resources a verified user can access.
- üë• **User Management:** Manages user identities, roles, and groups across systems.
- üîó **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Allows users to log in once and access multiple systems without re-authenticating.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Privileged Access Management (PAM):** Adds extra security for accounts with elevated privileges.
- üìä **Audit and Reporting:** Tracks user activities and logs them to support compliance and security policies.

Together, these components help organizations maintain security, improve efficiency, and reduce risks.

### How IAM Works üèóÔ∏è
IAM relies on the following mix of technologies and protocols to manage identities and enforce access controls effectively:
- üìù **User Enrollment:** Users are registered, often with verified credentials like government-issued IDs or company records.
- üîí **Credential Storage:** Credentials are securely stored, often encrypted, to prevent breaches.
- üìã **Access Policies:** Organizations define rules that control who can access what resources under specific conditions.
- üß© **Authentication Mechanisms:** Systems verify identities by using methods like MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication), biometrics, or token-based authentication.
- üìÇ **Access Provisioning:** After authentication, users are granted appropriate permissions based on their role or access level
- üëÄ **Monitoring and Revocation:** User activity is monitored to ensure appropriate access, with permissions adjusted or revoked as needed.

By combining these elements, IAM helps organizations manage security, streamline access, and reduce risk.

For a deeper dive into how IAM operates, check out our article: [**How Identity and Access Management Works: Detailed Guide**](https://supertokens.com/blog/identity-and-access-management). It breaks down each component in detail, helping you understand how IAM solutions keep your systems secure and efficient.

#### Okta Pricing

![Screenshot of Okta's pricing page](image.png)
[**Okta‚Äôs pricing**](https://www.okta.com/pricing/) is based on a **per-user model with extra costs for additional features** ‚Äî and those costs can add up fast. Their IAM platform has four pricing tiers: **Starter**, **Essentials**, **Professional**, and **Enterprise**.
- The **Starter plan** is the most affordable at **$6 per user/month**. It includes basics like Universal Directory, Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and up to five Workflows.
- If you need features like Adaptive MFA, Lifecycle Management, Access Governance, or Privileged Access, you‚Äôll be looking at **$17 per user/month.**
- For anything beyond that, you‚Äôll need to reach out to Okta for pricing.

**Regarding which one you choose, all plans are billed annually, so it would potentially require a substantial upfront cost.**

We have an article that further breaks down Okta's pricing for each feature if you are interested in checking it out -- [**Okta Pricing: The Complete Guide**](https://supertokens.com/blog/okta-pricing-the-complete-guide)

**Lastly, all plans require a minimum annual contract of $1,500, which could be a hurdle for smaller teams or companies just getting started, but seem fair and doable for larger or enterprise companies.**

#### OneLogin Pricing

![Screenshot of OneLogin's pricing page](image-1.png)
[**OneLogin‚Äôs pricing**](https://www.onelogin.com/product/pricing) also follows a **per-user model** with feature-based tiers, and it‚Äôs often seen as more budget-friendly than some competitors. OneLogin offers three main plans: **Starter**, **Advanced**, and **Professional**.
- The **Starter plan** begins at **$4 per user/month** and includes essentials like Single Sign-On (SSO), Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and basic reporting.
- For more **advanced security features** like Adaptive MFA, SmartFactor Authentication, and policy enforcement, you'll need the Advanced plan, which starts at **$8 per user/month**.
- The **Professional plan** offers enhanced capabilities like Lifecycle Management and advanced reporting, but **pricing requires contacting OneLogin directly**.

Similar to Okta, all OneLogin plans are billed annually, which may require a larger upfront investment.

**Unlike Okta, OneLogin doesn‚Äôt have a mandatory minimum contract, which may make it a better fit for smaller teams or those exploring IAM solutions for the first time.**
