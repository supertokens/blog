Looking to integrate authentication into your Supabase project using [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)? In this guide, we'll walk you through the process step-by-step.

We‚Äôll start with a basic, stateless React app and gradually add authentication and secure, user-specific data storage using Clerk and Supabase.

**What You‚Äôll Learn**
* Set up Clerk authentication in a Next.js app
* Connect Clerk and Supabase using JWTs
* Enforce Row-Level Security (RLS)
* Build a diagram editor where users can save their own content

We‚Äôll start with a no-auth version of the app, then add features gradually to see how each layer improves the developer and user experience.

> In **Part II**, we‚Äôll look at how to swap Clerk out for SuperTokens, an open-source alternative with advanced session management and more control. Clerk works great out of the box, especially if you want a managed solution.
> 
> But if you're the kind of dev who likes to dig deeper, customize flows, or self-host when needed, **SuperTokens** might be worth a look. If you're curious about what that looks like in practice, Part II will cover the details. **So stay tuned!** ‚ò∫Ô∏è

## How Clerk and Supabase Work Together

In this integration, Clerk and Supabase take on two distinct roles:

* **Clerk handles authentication and user identity** <br />It provides everything needed to securely sign users in like login flows, session management, and user IDs. Each authenticated user receives a unique userId that persists across your app.

* **Supabase handles data storage and access control** <br />It stores content (like saved diagrams in our demo app) and uses RLS policies to make sure that users can only access their own data.

### How the Integration Flow Works

1. **User signs in with Clerk**<br /> Clerk authenticates the user and returns a JWT containing the user‚Äôs `userId`.
2. **Your app sends the JWT to Supabase**<br />Supabase uses this token to identify the user on every request.
3. **Supabase enforces access rules via RLS** <br />For example:
    ```sql
    policy "Users can access their own charts"
    on charts
    for all
    using (auth.uid() = user_id);
    ```

> **RLS ensures each user sees only their own data, even in a shared database.**

**This works because**
* Authentication is fully managed by Clerk out of the box
* User data is stored in Supabase and automatically tied to individual user identities
* Row-Level Security (RLS) policies enforce strict access control, preventing users from viewing or altering data that isn't theirs

This separation of concerns results in a clean, secure, and scalable setup.

## Clerk and Supabase Integration: Project Overview

üêô **[View the full demo on GitHub](https://github.com/meems1996/mermaid-charting-app)**

This example app is built with Next.js and showcases how to integrate Clerk and Supabase to create a secure, user-aware experience.

### What the App Includes
* **MermaidJS Editor** -- Write and render Mermaid diagrams in real time
* **Clerk Authentication** -- Handle sign-up, login, and session management
* **Supabase Storage** -- Save diagrams to a secure, user-scoped database
* **Row-Level Security** -- Ensure users can only access their own data

Initially, the app is a simple, stateless tool: users can write and preview charts, but there‚Äôs no login or data persistence. Once the page reloads, everything is lost.

In this project, Supabase stores and retrieves each user's Mermaid charts. Every saved chart is linked to the unique user ID provided by Clerk. This setup ensures data is private, secure, and only visible to the right user.

This baseline helps highlight what Clerk and Supabase add when introduced.

### What You‚Äôll Build
We‚Äôll enhance the app by layering in:
1. **Clerk** ‚Äì For authentication and user identity
2. **Supabase** ‚Äì To store diagrams tied to each authenticated user

This integration turns a basic editor into a full-featured app with secure logins and personal saved charts.

By the end, you'll have a working example of how to combine authentication and secure data storage using Clerk and Supabase.

## Setting Up Clerk 
To get started with Clerk, follow these simple steps to set up authentication in your app.

### 1. Sign Up for Clerk 
First, head over to [Clerk's website](https://clerk.com/) and sign up for an account. You‚Äôll need to provide your email and create a password. Once you're in, you'll be taken to the Clerk dashboard, where you'll manage your app‚Äôs authentication settings.

### 2. Create a New Application
1. In your Clerk dashboard, click on the **Create Application** button.
2. Choose a name for your app (e.g., *Mermaid Visualizer*).
3. Choose the authentication methods from a list.
    - In this demo, we are selecting just the Email authentication method for simplicity.

**[Add screenshot of the selection window]**

<br />

Clerk will generate a set of steps to follow to continue setting up Clerk in your application.

### 3. Install the Clerk SDK 
To integrate Clerk into your project, you'll need to install the Clerk SDK. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash 
# If you're using npm 
npm install @clerk/nextjs

# If you're using yarn 
yarn add @clerk/nextjs

# If you're using pnpm
pnpm add @clerk/nextjs
```

### 4. Set your Clerk API keys
Add these keys to your `.env` file, or create the file if it doesn't exist. 

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-clerk-key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your-clerk-secret
```

### 5. Update `middleware.ts`
Update your middleware file, or create one at the **root** of your project, or the **src/** directory if you're using a src/ directory structure.

The `clerkMiddleware` helper enables authentication and is where you'll configure your protected routes.

```javascript
import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export default clerkMiddleware();

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // Skip Next.js internals and all static files, unless found in search params
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js(?!on)|jpe?g|webp|png|gif|svg|ttf|woff2?|ico|csv|docx?|xlsx?|zip|webmanifest)).*)',
    // Always run for API routes
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
};
```

### 6. Add ClerkProvider and the SignUp/SignIn Buttons

To enable Clerk throughout your app, you‚Äôll use the ClerkProvider in your layout.tsx file.

Here‚Äôs what to do:
* **Import the necessary components** from `@clerk/nextjs`.
* **Wrap your app** with `ClerkProvider` to make Clerk‚Äôs features available globally.
* Use `SignedOut` to wrap the `SignInButton` and`SignUpButton`. These will only appear when the user is signed out.
* Use `SignedIn` to wrap both the `UserButton` and your app‚Äôs content. These will only show when the user is signed in.

```javascript{4-12, 36, 41-45, 47-51, 56}
import { type Metadata } from "next";
import { Geist, Geist_Mono } from "next/font/google";
import "./globals.css";
// üîê Clerk components for authentication flows
import {
  ClerkProvider, // Wraps your app to provide authentication context
  SignInButton, // Renders a sign-in button that opens Clerk's sign-in modal
  SignUpButton, // Renders a sign-up button that opens Clerk's sign-up modal
  SignedIn, // Conditionally renders children *only* if the user is signed in
  SignedOut, // Conditionally renders children *only* if the user is signed out
  UserButton, // Displays the user's avatar with a dropdown for account management
} from '@clerk/nextjs'

const geistSans = Geist({
  variable: "--font-geist-sans",
  subsets: ["latin"],
});

const geistMono = Geist_Mono({
  variable: "--font-geist-mono",
  subsets: ["latin"],
});

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    // ‚úÖ ClerkProvider wraps the entire app, enabling access to auth state and Clerk components
    <ClerkProvider>
      <html lang="en">
        <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`} >
          <header className="p-5">

          {/* üëã Show these only when the user is signed out */}
          <SignedOut>
            <SignInButton /> {/* Opens a modal for users to sign in */}
            <SignUpButton /> {/* Opens a modal for users to create an account */}
          </SignedOut>

          {/* üôå Show these only when the user is signed in */}
          <SignedIn>
            <UserButton /> {/* Shows user profile options like sign out */}
            {children}  {/* Show the app content only to signed-in users */}
          </SignedIn>
          
        </header>
        </body>
      </html>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
```

üéâ And that‚Äôs it! You‚Äôve now set up Clerk for user authentication in your app. Users can sign in, sign up, and see personalized content based on their auth state.

### 7. Run Your Project and Get Your First User
Start your dev server:
```bash
# If you're using npm 
npm run dev

# If you're using yarn 
yarn dev

# If you're using pnpm
pnpm dev
```

Once it‚Äôs running, head to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You should see your app with sign-in and sign-up options. Go ahead and register‚Äîthis will create your first authenticated user.

Next up: we'll connect Supabase and set it up to store user-specific data like saved Mermaid charts.

## Setting Up Supabase with Clerk
To integrate Supabase with your Next.js project and secure user-specific data using Clerk authentication, follow these steps: 

### 1. Create a Supabase Project
* Visit [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/) and sign up for a free account.
* Once inside the dashboard, click **‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù**.
* Choose a **Project Name** (e.g. *Mermaid Visualizer*), select the **closest region** for your users, and set a strong password (you can use the ‚ÄúGenerate Password‚Äù feature).
* Save this password in your password manager.

### 2. Install Supabase Client
Install the Supabase JavaScript client in your project:
```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

### 3. Connect Clerk to Supabase (Updated 2025 Flow)
As of April 2025, Supabase has updated its integration method with Clerk from JWT templates to native third-party support‚Äîwhich simplifies setup and improves security.

Here's what to do: 
1. **Configure Clerk for Supabase:** In your Clerk dashboard, navigate to API Keys and enable Supabase compatibility.
2. **Add Clerk as a Third-Party Auth Provider in Supabase:** In Supabase, go to Authentication > Providers > External OAuth and select Clerk.

Follow Supabase's updated [Clerk integration guide](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/third-party/clerk) for exact values to paste (like issuer and JWKS URL).

### 4. Set Up Row-Level Security (RLS) with Clerk
By default, Supabase uses its own `auth.uid()` method, which doesn't work when using Clerk. To fix that, we'll extract the authenticated user's ID from the Clerk-provided JWT.

#### Create a Helper Function for Clerk IDs
In Supabase‚Äôs SQL Editor, paste the following:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION requesting_user_id()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
  SELECT NULLIF(
    current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'sub',
    ''
  )::text;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL STABLE;
```
This function safely retrieves the authenticated Clerk user ID from the incoming JWT token.

#### Create the `charts` Table
Run the following SQL to create a table and enable RLS with Clerk support: 

```sql
create table if not exists charts (
  id UUID default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  content text not null,
  user_id text not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);
```

#### Add RLS Policies (the Right Way for Clerk)

```sql
alter table charts enable row level security;

create policy "Users can insert their own charts"
  on charts
  for insert
  with check (
    user_id = current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'sub'
  );

create policy "Users can view their own charts"
  on charts
  for select
  using (
    user_id = current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'sub'
  );
```

#### Common Pitfall: `auth.uid()` Returns NULL
If you previously used this:
```sql
USING (auth.uid()::text = user_id)
```

...it won't work with Clerk. Why? 
* `auth.uid()` is only available if you're using **Supabase Auth**, which we‚Äôre not.
* Clerk user IDs are strings like `"user_2w2a6PJC4T4BfXDsg72AQsLNEyU"`, which are not UUIDs.
* This mismatch causes errors like:
    ```text
    invalid input syntax for type uuid: "user_..."
    ```

**The Fix:**
Use this pattern instead: 

```sql
current_setting('request.jwt.claims', true)::json->>'sub'
```
This safely extracts the sub field (i.e. the Clerk user ID) from the JWT, allowing you to scope data per user, securely and correctly.

## Integrating Clerk and Supabase in Next.js

Clerk and Supabase work together seamlessly to manage authentication and user-specific data in your Next.js app. Here‚Äôs how the integration functions:
1. **Authentication with Clerk**: When a user logs in, Clerk authenticates them and generates a unique user ID and session token.
2. **Data Storage with Supabase**: That user ID is used to store and retrieve data (e.g. Mermaid charts) in the Supabase database, scoped to the logged-in user.

Let‚Äôs break down how to implement this integration in code:

### Middleware for Clerk Authentication
The `middleware.ts` file ensures that all routes requiring authentication are protected by Clerk. It intercepts requests and verifies the session before allowing access:

```javascript 
import { clerkMiddleware } from "@clerk/nextjs/server";

export default clerkMiddleware();

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    '/((?!_next|[^?]*\\.(?:html?|css|js|png|svg)).*)',
    '/(api|trpc)(.*)',
  ],
};
```

### Supabase Provider with Clerk Session Token
In order to securely access Supabase on behalf of the authenticated user, we initialize a Supabase client using the session token provided by Clerk:

```javascript 
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import { useSession } from "@clerk/nextjs";

export default function SupabaseProvider({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { session } = useSession();
  const supabase = createClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!, { 
      accessToken: () => session?.getToken() 
    }
  );

  return <Context.Provider value={{ supabase }}>{children}</Context.Provider>;
}
```

## Code Walkthrough 
You can explore the full codebase in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/meems1996/mermaid-charting-app).

### Saving Charts
The `handleSave` function stores a Mermaid chart in your Supabase database, associating it with the currently logged-in user:

```javascript 
const handleSave = async () => {
  if (!supabase || !user) return;

  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('charts')
    .insert({ content: code, user_id: user.id });

  if (error) console.error('Error saving chart:', error);
};
```

### Fetching Charts
The `fetchCharts` function retrieves all charts for the authenticated user, ordered by creation time:

```javascript 
const fetchCharts = async () => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('charts')
    .select('content')
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false });

  if (data) setSavedCharts(data.map((item) => item.content));
};
```

### Challenges and Solutions
* **Session Management**: <br />*Challenge:* Ensure Clerk‚Äôs session is available before initializing Supabase. <br />*Solution:* Use useEffect to wait for the session before creating the Supabase client.
* **Error Handling**: <br />*Challenge:* Errors when saving or fetching data can disrupt the UX.<br />*Solution:* Implement error checks and show clear feedback to the user.

## What About Session Security? (The Hidden Risk No One Talks About)

Clerk and Supabase handle authentication and data storage effectively. However, **session security is often overlooked**. Potential risks include:

- **Stolen Tokens:** If access tokens are compromised, unauthorized users can gain access.
- **Replay Attacks:** Attackers can reuse valid tokens to impersonate users.
- **Session Hijacking:** Without proper session management, attackers can hijack active sessions.

These vulnerabilities highlight the need for **robust session management** solutions.

## How SuperTokens Fixes This Problem

**SuperTokens** addresses session security concerns with features like:

- **Self-Hosted Authentication and Session Management:** Gives developers full control over user sessions.
- **Token Theft Detection and Refresh Token Rotation:** Mitigates risks associated with stolen tokens.
- **Fine-Grained Session Revocation:** Allows users to log out from individual devices, enhancing security.

By integrating **SuperTokens with Supabase**, developers can achieve a **more secure and flexible authentication system**.  

## How SuperTokens Handles Session Security (In Practice)
Clerk and Supabase offer excellent developer experience, but session management often remains a blind spot. SuperTokens fills this gap with **robust protections out of the box**:

| Threat                | Risk Without Protection               | How SuperTokens Mitigates                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Token Theft**       | Attacker reuses a valid refresh token | Detects reuse, revokes all sessions from the compromised device |
| **Session Hijacking** | No way to target a specific device    | Revoke individual sessions without logging user out everywhere  |
| **Replay Attacks**    | Attacker reuses old valid tokens      | Rotates refresh tokens, detects and blocks reuse                |

SuperTokens stands out in session management and security, offering features not natively available in Clerk or Supabase.

## Custom Auth Flows with SuperTokens
SuperTokens lets you override every piece of the logic‚Äîperfect for apps with unique flows or compliance requirements.

Example: Add custom sign-in behavior:

```javascript
override: {
  functions: (original) => ({
    ...original,
    signInUp: async (input) => {
      // Custom logic here
    }
  })
}
```
You can also build your own UI, or start with theirs and customize as needed.

* [See how to override core logic](https://supertokens.com/docs/references/frontend-sdks/function-overrides)
* [Build your own UI](https://supertokens.com/docs/quickstart/frontend-setup)

## Should You Use Clerk, SuperTokens, or Both?
* **Use Clerk** if you prefer a fully managed solution with pre-built UI components for quick setup.
* **Use SuperTokens** if you require advanced session management, self-hosting, and enhanced security features.
* **Use Both** if you want the ease of Clerk's UI components combined with SuperTokens' robust session security.

By integrating both, you can leverage the strengths of each platform to build a secure and user-friendly application.

## Migrating from Clerk to SuperTokens
[If you want to move from Clerk to SuperTokens](https://supertokens.com/docs/migration/overview), you don‚Äôt need to rip everything out. You can migrate gradually:
* Start by using SuperTokens for session control only
* Keep Clerk's UI until you're ready to swap it out
* Migrate login/signup flows one at a time

## Clerk + Supabase Is a Great Start But SuperTokens Takes You Further
The Clerk + Supabase integration gives you an elegant way to manage authentication and user-specific data. You now have:
* A fully working app with secure logins
* Personalized chart storage
* RLS-enforced data access

But if you're building something more complex, security-sensitive, or enterprise-grade, you might want:
* Full control over how sessions behave
* Stronger defenses against token-based attacks
* The ability to self-host or customize every aspect of auth

That‚Äôs where SuperTokens shines.

In **Part II**, we'll show you how to achieve similar functionality using SuperTokens with Supabase for more control over authentication and session management.
