Once again, Hacktoberfest is upon us ðŸŽ‰

As an open-source company, we're proud to celebrate it and motivate more people to contribute to the software they use every day. Of course, that means some of our repositories will be a part of this year's Hacktoberfest effort. But before we get into the details of how you can contribute to SuperTokens - let's have a quick recap ðŸ™‚

## What's Hacktoberfest?

To quote the official website, [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is "A month-long celebration of all things open-source". The first Hacktoberfest took place back in 2013. It started as a simple idea - during October, everyone's encouraged to make 4 pull request to an open source repository, and if their PR gets accepted, the contributor is rewarded with a limited edition t-shirt.

Hacktoberfest started as a fairly small affair but grew into a global phenomenon in which thousands of people contribute to open source. So, if you were looking for a reason to start contributing back to open source - Hacktoberfest is as good of a reason as any :)

## SuperTokens at Hacktoberfest

This year, we've decided to include one repository in Hacktoberfest: Our CLI, create-supertokens-app - https://github.com/supertokens/create-supertokens-app

The reason behind it is simple - the number one question a developer might ask when first getting in contact with SuperTokens is, "How do I integrate my stack with SuperTokens"?
To answer that, we've realized a well-documented example may work best. Thus, we've decided to focus on exactly that - got a stack we don't have an example for? Help us cover it! :)

### How to contribute to the `create-supertokens-app` CLI

The number one contribution type we're looking for is new scaffolds using our pre-built UI. What that means in practice is:

1. Carefully read through the [contribution guide](https://github.com/supertokens/create-supertokens-app/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Check whether we support your chosen [backend](https://github.com/supertokens/create-supertokens-app/tree/master/boilerplate/backend), [frontend](https://github.com/supertokens/create-supertokens-app/tree/master/boilerplate/frontend) or [fullstack](https://github.com/supertokens/create-supertokens-app/tree/master/boilerplate/fullstack).
3. Before getting started, create a GitHub issue with the name and details of your scaffold submission. You can connect and collaborate if a similar contribution issue has been opened. These things are always easier in a team. ðŸ˜‰
4. Make sure to follow the Hacktoberfest [guidelines](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#contributors)
5. Stuck? Got questions? Hit us up on [discord](https://supertokens.com/discord)! Make sure to use the dedicated #hacktoberfest-2024 channel for this purpose.

We're okay with other kinds of contributions too (think README improvements and general doc improvements for the individual scaffolds), but in line with the Hacktoberfest guidelines, we're also not going to accept small typo fixes as valid.

### Other ways to contribute

Got something else in mind? Thinking about writing an article or a tutorial about SuperTokens? We might be able to do something about that too. Ping us on [discord](https://supertokens.com/discord) on the #hacktoberfest-2024, and we'll figure something out together.

### Rewards

We're currently working on an Ambassador and Contributor programs for our community members. Every valid contribution to our repos above makes you eligible for those roles. Details coming soon ðŸ˜‰

## Conclusion

Hacktoberfest is a great opportunity to contribute to the open source ecosystem and gain some experience and exposure for yourself, regardless of your experience level. We at SuperTokens are happy to support the effort! See you on the other side of those 4 PRs ðŸ™‚
