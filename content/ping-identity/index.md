In an era where applications and data span on‑premises infrastructures, cloud environments, and mobile devices, organizations need robust
identity and access management (IAM) solutions. Ping Identity has emerged as a leading enterprise IAM provider, offering federated Single
Sign‑On (SSO), adaptive Multi‑Factor Authentication (MFA), directory services, and advanced access controls. However, with other platforms&mdash;such as Okta, ForgeRock, OneLogin, and SuperTokens&mdash;vying for developer and enterprise mindshare, how does Ping Identity truly stack up?

This post delivers a developer‑centric, unbiased comparison of the major IAM offerings on the market. We'll discuss Ping Identity's history, ownership, core services, and ideal use cases, followed by head‑to‑head breakdowns against ForgeRock, Okta, OneLogin, and SuperTokens. By the end, you'll have clarity on which platform best aligns with your organization's technical and business requirements.

## **What Is Ping Identity & Who Owns It?**

![Ping Identity](Ping-Identity.png)

Founded in 2002 by Andre Durand and Bryan Field‑Elliot, Ping Identity Corporation set out to address the growing complexity of authentication and access management in heterogeneous environments. The company's flagship solutions include PingFederate (federation server), PingID (adaptive MFA), PingAccess (access management), PingDirectory (LDAP‑based directory), PingAuthorize (policy engine), and
PingIntelligence (AI‑driven threat detection).

In October 2022, [ThomaBravo](https://www.thomabravo.com/press-releases/thoma-bravo-completes-acquisition-of-ping-identity), a leading software private equity firm, completed its acquisition of Ping Identity for \$2.8 billion in cash. This transaction concluded an agreement first announced on August 3, 2022, and approved by shareholders on October 17, 2022. As a privately held company under Thoma Bravo's portfolio, Ping Identity benefits from significant investment capacity and strategic guidance aimed at consolidating complementary identity solutions.

## **What Does Ping Identity Do and What Is It Used For?**

Ping Identity's integrated platform addresses critical IAM needs:

-   **Federated Single Sign‑On (SSO)** via PingFederate and PingOne, supporting SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, WS‑Trust, and WS‑Federation. These capabilities simplify access management across cloud and on-prem systems while maintaining robust securityand compliance standards.
-   **Adaptive Multi‑Factor Authentication (MFA)** through PingID, enabling step‑up and risk‑based policies that leverage device posture, geo‑location, and behavior analytics. This approach enhances protection while minimizing user friction, with contextual policies tailored to dynamic user behavior and threat landscapes.
-   **Directory Services** with [PingDirectory](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/product/pingdirectory.html), a high‑performance LDAP server designed for scaling millions of identities. It ensures high availability, low latency, and strong data consistency, making it suitable for real-time identity operations in large-scale environments.
-   **Access Security** via [PingAccess](https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/capabilities/authorization/pingaccess.html), enforcing access policies for applications and APIs. It offers fine-grained control over resource access, integrating easily with both legacy applications and modern APIs for consistent policy enforcement.
-   **Policy‑Based Authorization** using PingAuthorize to manage context‑aware entitlements. It allows organizations to centrally define and enforce authorization policies based on attributes like user role, location, time, and device, supporting dynamic decision-making at runtime.
-   **AI‑Enhanced Threat Detection** through PingIntelligence for API cybersecurity and anomaly detection. This component leverages machine learning to detect malicious behaviors and usage anomalies in real time, helping prevent advanced threats and data breaches across digital assets.

### **Enterprise Use Cases**

1.  **Employee (B2E) Authentication:** Secure workforce SSO and MFA across cloud, on‑prem, and mobile apps.
2.  **Zero Trust Environments:** Enforce least‑privilege access policies at the network, application, and data layer.
3.  **Hybrid Deployments:** Seamlessly integrate on‑prem LDAP, Active Directory, and emerging cloud identity stores.
4.  **Regulated Industries:** Achieve compliance (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR) via audit trails, encryption, and strong authentication.

### **Limitations**

While Ping Identity excels in complex enterprise scenarios, its breadth and configurability can introduce overhead: lengthy deployment cycles, steeper learning curves, and high licensing costs may deter agile startups or dev‑first teams.

## **SuperTokens vs Ping Identity -- Modern vs Enterprise IAM**

-   *Ping Identity* is ideal for large enterprises&mdash;banks, governments, and Fortune 500s&mdash;requiring deep integration, compliance, and centralized management.

## **Ping Identity vs ForgeRock**

![ForgeRock](ForgeRock.png)

### **Shared Ownership & Background**

Both Ping Identity and ForgeRock now reside under Thoma Bravo's ownership: [Ping acquired in October 2022 for \$2.8 billion](https://www.thomabravo.com/press-releases/thoma-bravo-completes-acquisition-of-ping-identity); [ForgeRock for \$2.3 billion in October 2022](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-operations/thoma-bravo-practical-decision-merge-forgerock-into-ping-identity), closed in August 2023, and subsequently merged into Ping Identity.

### **Platform Philosophy**

 
| **Capability**              | **Ping Identity**         |  **ForgeRock**          |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------ |
| **Federation**              | SAML, OAuth, OIDC via PingFederate     |   SAML, OAuth, OIDC via ForgeRock AM|
| **Directory**               | PingDirectory (LDAP)      |  ForgeRock Directory Services (DS)    |
| **Workflow/Orchestration**  | Limited out‑of‑the‑box, relies on partner tools   |  Native orchestration engine for complex flows  |
| **Developer Extensibility** | Config‑driven adapters, REST APIs  |  Groovy scripting, custom authentication modules     |

### **Overlap**

Both offer SSO, MFA, and directory services. ForgeRock's orchestration and open‑source roots make it appealing for highly customized identity journeys, whereas Ping Identity generally delivers faster time‑to‑value with a more opinionated, packaged experience.

Additionally, ForgeRock tends to be favored in environments requiring complex policy enforcement and advanced user journey control. Ping, on the other hand, excels in hybrid IT and cloud-first environments where speed and ease of deployment are priorities.

Both platforms support modern identity standards like OAuth, OIDC, and SAML, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of enterprise systems. Ultimately, the choice often depends on organizational
priorities&mdash;flexibility versus speed.

### **SuperTokens Lens**

SuperTokens provides core SSO and MFA capabilities similar to Ping and ForgeRock, but without the orchestration overhead. It's built for
developers who want lightweight, pluggable auth without enterprise complexity or legacy baggage.
