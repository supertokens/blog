## Authelia vs. Authentik Tool Comparison

### Security Features

Security is the core of any authentication system. Authelia emphasizes strong authentication policies, including Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enforcement, security challenge mechanisms, and zero-trust security models. It integrates closely with reverse proxies, ensuring that access control is enforced at the gateway level before users reach backend services. However, since it does not act as a full Identity Provider (IdP), it lacks fine-grained identity management capabilities.

Authentik, in contrast, is a full-fledged IdP that provides more advanced authentication workflows. It supports **LDAP and RADIUS authentication backends**, allowing integration with legacy systems. Additionally, it includes [Just-In-Time (JIT) user provisioning](https://jumpcloud.com/blog/jit-provisioning-defined), [identity federation](https://aws.amazon.com/identity/federation/), and [attribute-based access control (ABAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control), making it more suited for managing complex security policies across multiple applications.

#### Security Strengths and Weaknesses

| Feature | Authelia | Authentik |
|---------|---------|-----------|
