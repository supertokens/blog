If you've been watching Auth0 closely, you've likely noticed the storm brewing in developer communities. When [Okta acquired Auth0 in 2021](https://supertokens.com/blog/the-real-reason-okta-spent-on-auth0), many anticipated changes, but few could have predicted just how significant they'd be. Fast forward to late 2023, and the price hikes have left both startups and enterprises questioning the value of sticking with Auth0.

Let's dive into the specifics, leveraging data from recent price updates and the opinions shared by developers.

## Understanding Auth0’s Pricing Updates

In November 2023, Okta rolled out a revised pricing structure for Auth0 that introduced higher costs across the board. For instance:

- **B2C Essentials** jumped from **$23/month for 1,000 MAU** to **$35/month for 500 MAU**, effectively **doubling** the cost per user.
- **B2C Professional** remains priced at **$240/month** but now serves **half as many users** as before.

These aren't just minor adjustments—they fundamentally reshape the cost-benefit equation for many teams.

| Plan              | Previous Pricing         | New Pricing          | Percentage Increase |
|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| B2C Essentials    | $23/mo for 1000 MAU        | $35/mo for 500 MAU    | ~200%               |
| B2B Essentials    | $130/mo for 500 MAU        | $150/mo for 500 MAU   | 15.38%              |
| B2C Professional  | $240/mo for 1000 MAU       | $240/mo for 500 MAU   | 200%                |
| B2B Professional  | $800/mo for 500 MAU        | $800/mo for 500 MAU   | No change           |

## Developer Reactions: Sticker Shock and Discontent

A [Reddit thread from October 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/18d6hcd/auth0_increases_price_by_300/) captures the mood perfectly: many developers feel blindsided by the hikes.

The most common pain points include:

- **Fewer Users, Higher Costs**: MAU limits were slashed across tiers, forcing businesses to pay more for less.
- **Uncertainty Around Future Hikes**: There's widespread skepticism about whether this is the last price increase. Developers are reluctant to commit long-term.

Most devs using Auth0 feel like they're locked into a contract with a ticking time bomb, but don't take our word for it:

## Why This Matters

Auth0’s pricing model is particularly challenging for small teams and startups, many of which operate on tight budgets. These organizations often bank on rapid user growth, but under the new structure, growth can become prohibitively expensive.

### Locked Into the Wrong Plan?

If you selected a plan expecting to scale, you may now face ballooning costs. Worse, migrating to another provider mid-growth is often complex and resource-intensive.

## Why Is My Auth0 Price Suddenly Changing?

If your Auth0 bill has spiked unexpectedly, you're not alone. Many developers and teams have voiced concerns about how subtle changes to their subscription—or even natural growth in MAUs—trigger steep price increases. Let's break this down.

### Auth0 Increasing Their Plans

1. **Even Minor Changes Can Force a Price Upgrade**

   One of the most significant factors causing price jumps is subscription modifications. Auth0’s 2023 pricing update introduced strict new rules:
   
   - If you adjust your plan or features, the updated pricing structure immediately takes effect—even if you're only adding a minor feature.
   - Existing customers are "grandfathered" into their old pricing, but any tweaks to the plan force a switch to the newer, costlier models.

2. **MAU Overages and Their Impact on Billing**

   MAU (Monthly Active Users) caps are another hidden cost driver:

   - Plans like **B2C Essentials** now serve **500 MAU** instead of **1,000 MAU**, meaning even modest growth could push you into a higher tier.
   - Overages are billed at punitive rates, which can significantly inflate costs during high-traffic months.
   - For fast-scaling startups or teams dealing with unpredictable user patterns, these limits are particularly restrictive.

3. **Advanced Features and Add-On Costs**

   Auth0’s tiered pricing hides an important truth: some advanced features are only accessible as paid add-ons. Whether it's enhanced security options or custom branding, many of these "premium" features require costly upgrades. This creates a frustrating trade-off for teams who need robust functionality but can't justify the steep price.

4. **The Yearly Renewal "Screwover"**

   Another common pain point is yearly renewals. Auth0’s contracts often lock customers into a specific MAU count and feature set. When renewal time comes around, businesses are charged for growth—even if their needs remain largely the same. This leaves teams feeling like they're being penalized for success.

---

## Your Plan Changing Models

Auth0’s pricing model emphasizes MAUs and feature access, making it vital to understand how these elements interact. Here's a quick look at how plans are structured:

- **MAU Thresholds**: Plans like **B2B Essentials** cap at **500 MAU**. If you grow beyond that, you're automatically upgraded to a higher-priced plan, even if your usage only slightly exceeds the limit.

- **Feature Lockdowns**: Many features are locked behind higher tiers. This includes essentials like role-based access control (RBAC) or custom domains, which require paying for Professional Plans or add-ons.

---

## What This Means for Your Budget

For developers, Auth0’s pricing complexity makes it easy to exceed budgets, sometimes without realizing it until the invoice arrives. Businesses with rapid growth or shifting needs may find themselves outgrowing their plans faster than expected.

### Takeaways:
- Review your current MAU usage frequently to avoid surprise overages.
- Be cautious when making changes to your subscription, as even small adjustments can trigger the new pricing structure.
- Compare alternatives to Auth0 that offer predictable pricing without MAU caps or hidden fees.

## Navigating Pricing Challenges: Exploring Alternatives

For many businesses, Auth0’s pricing model creates a dilemma: stay locked in and absorb the costs or explore alternatives and manage a migration. Let's unpack why Auth0’s structure poses challenges and how you can effectively navigate them.

### Managing Overages: A Practical Approach

If you're currently facing overages on Auth0, here's a game plan:

- **Stay on Auth0, Migrate Slowly**: Use a lazy migration strategy where new users are onboarded onto an alternative solution like **SuperTokens**. This reduces costs while keeping your existing setup intact.

- **Hybrid Approach**: Overages on Auth0 can be mitigated by directing a subset of your users to a new authentication provider. For instance, high-MAU scenarios might justify splitting your user base between providers to avoid cost spikes.

### During Renewals: Leveraging Negotiations

Auth0’s pricing may seem rigid, but in reality, there's room for negotiation during contract renewals. Here's how to maximize your leverage:

- **Get Competitive Quotes**: Reach out to providers like **SuperTokens** and obtain a quote. Auth0’s pricing is more flexible than advertised, and a competing offer can often lead to substantial discounts.

- **Know Your Value**: Emphasize your MAU volume and loyalty during negotiations. Auth0 frequently adjusts rates for businesses willing to sign longer contracts or commit to larger plans.

Breaking free from Auth0’s "golden handcuffs" requires careful planning, but the long-term savings and flexibility are worth the effort. Whether you opt for a phased migration or use competing quotes to renegotiate, there's no need to feel stuck.
