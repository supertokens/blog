In today’s world of logins, passwords, and the eternal struggle to remember which one you used where, organizations are on the hunt for single sign-on (SSO) solutions that don’t just work but actually make life easier. Think security that doesn’t buckle under pressure, scalability that grows with you, and integrations that play nice with all your apps and systems—basically, the holy trinity of access control.

And let’s be real, not everyone wants to hand over their identity management to the big-name players like Auth0, Okta, or AWS Cognito. Enter the self-hosted, open-source underdogs: Authelia and Keycloak. These tools have been quietly (or not so quietly) winning over businesses and developers who like their solutions flexible, customizable, and, well, free. Because who doesn’t love a good DIY project that actually works?

Both Authelia and Keycloak provide identity and access management (IAM) solutions tailored for different use cases. Authelia is a lightweight self-hosted authentication and authorization server designed primarily for reverse proxy integration with solutions like Traefik, NGINX, and Docker-based environments. It is particularly well-suited for forward auth and enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA), such as TOTP and WebAuthn, for protecting self-hosted applications.

On the other hand, Keycloak is a full-fledged identity provider (IdP) built for enterprise-level IAM deployments. It supports OAuth 2.0, OIDC, SAML, and LDAP, making it a versatile solution for user management, identity federation, and role-based access control (RBAC). Keycloak is often used in large-scale environments requiring scalability, permissions management, and extensive API integrations.

Deciding between Authelia and Keycloak is a bit like choosing between a trusty Swiss Army knife and a full-blown toolbox—it all comes down to your needs. Key factors like SSO requirements, integration flexibility, security features, performance, and budget all play a role in the decision. If you’re exploring alternatives to Keycloak, you might want to check out SuperTokens, an open-source authentication platform that’s all about modern, passwordless magic. For a deep dive into how Keycloak stacks up against SuperTokens, you can [read this in-depth comparison article](https://supertokens.com/blog/supertokens-vs-keycloak). (Yes, it’s as nerdy and helpful as it sounds.)

In this article, we will compare Authelia vs Keycloak across several key dimensions, including single sign-on (SSO), integration options, user management, security features, scalability and performance, community support, and cost & licensing. By the end, you will have a clear understanding of which solution best fits your specific authentication and IAM needs.

## Authelia: An Overview

[Authelia](https://www.authelia.com) is an open-source, self-hosted authentication and authorization solution designed to provide single sign-on (SSO) for web applications operating behind a reverse proxy. Unlike full-fledged identity providers (IdPs) like Keycloak, Auth0, or Okta, Authelia focuses on providing forward authentication (forward auth) and access control for users accessing services through a reverse proxy such as Traefik, NGINX, or Apache. For more information on Authelia's setup and configuration, visit the official [Authelia documentation](https://www.authelia.com/overview/prologue/architecture/).

Authelia is like the minimalist’s dream for self-hosted setups—perfect for developers and sysadmins who want a lightweight but rock-solid authentication layer to guard their internal apps. It plays nicely with Docker, Docker-Compose, and Kubernetes, making it a breeze to roll out in containerized environments. But here’s the catch: Authelia isn’t a full-blown identity provider. Instead, it’s more of a middleware maestro, meaning it needs a sidekick like LDAP, Active Directory, or an OIDC-compliant IdP to handle the actual user authentication. Think of it as the bouncer at the door, but it needs someone else to check the guest list.

### Key Features of Authelia

Authelia offers a range of features designed to enhance authentication, authorization, and access control within a self-hosted ecosystem:

* Single Sign-On (SSO): Enables centralized authentication across multiple services and applications behind a reverse proxy.
* Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Supports TOTP, WebAuthn, and Duo Security, adding an extra layer of security for user authentication.
* Fine-Grained Access Control: Uses a policy-driven approach to define permissions, restricting access to resources based on user roles and groups.
* Forward Authentication (Forward Auth): Works as a middleware to authenticate requests before granting access to backend services.
* Integration with External Identity Providers: Supports authentication through LDAP, OIDC, OAuth 2.0, and SAML, making it flexible for various infrastructures.
* Lightweight and High Performance: Optimized for low-resource environments, making it ideal for small to medium-scale self-hosted deployments.
* Containerized Deployment: Easily deployable using Docker, Docker-Compose, or Kubernetes, streamlining deployment and maintenance.

### How Authelia Works

Authelia acts like the gatekeeper of your self-hosted kingdom, sitting snugly between your reverse proxy and the applications it guards. When someone tries to access a protected service, the reverse proxy sends them straight to Authelia for a credential check. If the user passes the test, they’re in\! And if you want to crank up the security, Authelia can throw in multi-factor authentication (MFA) as an extra hurdle before granting access.

This setup makes Authelia a fantastic pick for locking down self-hosted dashboards, internal dev tools, and admin panels—all without the headache of deploying a full-blown identity provider (IdP). By using forward auth, Authelia keeps things running smoothly, handling authentication requests like a pro while letting your apps stay blissfully unaware of the security magic happening behind the scenes. It’s like having a bouncer who also doubles as a ninja.

### Typical Use Cases for Authelia

Authelia is an ideal solution for:

* Self-Hosted Environments: Protects services like Home Assistant, Nextcloud, Bitwarden, and Jellyfin behind a reverse proxy.
* Reverse Proxy Authentication: Works seamlessly with Traefik, NGINX, and Caddy to secure internal applications.
* Lightweight SSO Deployments: Offers single sign-on (SSO) for multiple applications without requiring an external identity provider.
* Docker-Based Infrastructures: Easily deployable via Docker-Compose, making it convenient for developers managing containerized environments.
* MFA-Enforced Security: Strengthens authentication with multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security in self-hosted applications.

While Authelia excels in self-hosted scenarios, it may not be the best choice for large-scale enterprise deployments requiring advanced user management, identity federation, and fine-grained RBAC. For those use cases, solutions like Keycloak, Zitadel, or SuperTokens may be more suitable.

Coming up next, we’ll dive into the world of Keycloak—its features, its quirks, and how it stacks up against Authelia in the wild world of authentication and IAM. Whether you’re securing a small project or scaling up for enterprise-level chaos, we’ll break it all down so you can decide which tool deserves a spot in your tech stack. Stay tuned\!
