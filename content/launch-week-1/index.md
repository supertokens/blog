We've been busy. Like, really busy.
Over the past few months, we've been rebuilding and updating some of the  core parts of SuperTokens. The kind of foundational work that doesn't make for flashy announcements but makes everything else possible.
So instead of dropping it all at once, we're doing something more fun: **SuperTokens Launch Week**.

## What's Coming

**Five days. Five announcements. All focused on making auth easier to integrate.**

Each day brings something you can actually use, play with, integrate. No vaporware, no empty hype - just tools and resources that make implementing auth faster and less frustrating.

## Why Launch Week?

Simple - Because dropping everything at once is overwhelming. We'd rather give you time to actually try each thing, provide feedback, and help us make it better.
Plus, it's more fun this way. Each announcement builds on the previous ones, creating a complete picture of where SuperTokens is heading ðŸ™‚

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about new featuresâ€”it's about a different approach to auth tooling. Instead of making you adapt to SuperTokens, we're bringing SuperTokens to you. Whether you're using Next.js, Django, Express, or that custom setup you built at 2 AM.
The goal is simple: **get to working auth faster so you can focus on the interesting parts of your application.**

Follow along: We'll be posting updates throughout the week on our [blog](https://supertokens.com/blog) and [social](https://www.linkedin.com/company/supertokens/) [media](https://x.com/supertokensio).

Try the new stuff: Most of what we announce will be available immediately. No waiting, no beta signups.

Give us feedback: Seriously. We're building this for you, so tell us what works and what doesn't.

Let's make auth better together.
