## The Battle of Identity Providers ü§∫

Security is a crucial part of any business. When securing your company resources, one of the decisions you will need to make is to choose an Identity and Access Management (IAM) solution. 

Let‚Äôs meet our two contenders for today!

In the blue corner, we have Okta &mdash; the cloud-native security expert. And in the red corner, Azure AD &mdash; the heavyweight champion of enterprises. Who will emerge victorious in the IAM battle royale? Let‚Äôs find out!


### Why Identity and Access Management (IAM) is Critical for Businesses Today
IAM makes sure that only the right people, machines, and apps have access to the right resources from your company at the right time. 

Cyberattacks often target compromised user credentials, making IAM a vital layer of protection. With IAM, you can:

- Verify and authenticate users securely.
- Track and manage user access.
- Automate user provisioning and de-provisioning to reduce security risks.

If you want to learn more about the benefits of IAM for your business' security, we've written a more in-depth article on this topic: [**8 Benefits of Identity and Access Management (IAM) for Security**](https://supertokens.com/blog/8-benefits-of-identity-and-access-management-for-security).

### Quick Intro to Okta and Azure AD &mdash; Two of the Biggest Players in the IAM Space

Let's get into a little introduction about the two giants in the IAM space &mdash; Okta and Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID)

We‚Äôll use both names &mdash; Azure AD and Microsoft Entra ID &mdash; throughout this article. Microsoft is still transitioning to the new name, and we want to clarify that they refer to the same product.

### Okta: The Cloud IAM Wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
![Okta homepage screenshot](image.png)
[**Okta**](https://www.okta.com/) is a San Francisco-based company that makes cloud software to help businesses manage and protect user logins. It was founded in 2009 and became a public company in 2017. Okta is comprised of Okta Platform and Auth0 Platform. 

In this guide we are going over Okta Platform which is Okta's IAM solution for secure authentication of your employees, contractors, and partners. 

**The Key Features of Okta Platform:**
- **Single Sign On** &mdash; One username, one password, and you‚Äôre in! Employees can access everything they need from one handy dashboard, no matter what device they‚Äôre using.
- **Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication** &mdash; Extra security that‚Äôs smart. Depending on things like where you‚Äôre logging in from, it might ask for a second step ‚Äî like confirming on your phone or scanning your fingerprint.
- **Identity Governance** &mdash; Think of this as organized access control. It makes sure people only get access to what they actually need ‚Äî and keeps track of it all for security peace of mind.
- **Privileged Access** &mdash; Some accounts need extra protection. Provides additional safeguards for sensitive accounts by granting higher-level controls to administrators and limiting access to critical systems.
- **Identity Threat Protection** &mdash; Detects suspicious activity, like unusual login attempts, and takes steps to block threats before they cause harm.
- **Lifecycle Management** &mdash; Automates user account creation and removal, so when employees join, switch roles, or leave, their access updates automatically.
- **Extensive App Integrations** &mdash; Connects seamlessly with over 7,000 pre-built app integrations, making it easy to link Okta with the tools your team already uses.

#### Pros and Cons of Okta 

| **Pros**                         | **Cons**                        |
|:----------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Works with any tech stack       | ‚ùå Can get pricey as you scale    |
| ‚úÖ Tons of app integrations        | ‚ùå Limited on-premises support     |
| ‚úÖ Great for businesses of all sizes |                                 |


### Azure AD: The Microsoft Identity Fortress üè∞
![Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID) homepage screenshot](image-1.png)

[**Microsoft Entra ID**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id) &mdash; previously called Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) &mdash; is Microsoft's IAM product built to help you manage and protect identities across both cloud and on-premises environments. It‚Äôs tightly integrated with Azure, Office 365, and Windows, making it a natural fit for businesses already using Microsoft services.

**The Key Features of Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD):**
- **Single Sign-On (SSO) and Conditional Access** &mdash; Users can sign in once to securely access Microsoft 365 and other connected apps. Conditional Access adds extra security by requiring things like MFA or location checks when needed.

- **Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** &mdash; Strengthens security by asking for additional verification, such as a phone notification or biometric scan, especially when logging in from unfamiliar devices or locations.

- **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** &mdash; Some accounts need extra protection. Provides additional safeguards for sensitive accounts by granting higher-level controls to administrators and limiting access to critical systems

- **Hybrid Identity Support** &mdash; Supports hybrid identity by bridging cloud and on-premises environments, allowing integration with existing Active Directory setups.

#### Pros and Cons of Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)

| **Pros**                                   | **Cons**                                        |
|:--------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Perfect for Microsoft-heavy environments | ‚ùå Less flexible for multi-cloud setups            |
| ‚úÖ Built-in security tools (Defender, Intune, etc.) | ‚ùå Not as developer-friendly for third-party integrations |
| ‚úÖ Strong on-prem and hybrid cloud support  |                                                   |

## Okta vs Azure AD ‚Äì The IAM Showdown ü•ä

| **Pricing & Scalability** üí∞ | While Okta's per-user pricing can become expensive at scale, it offers a highly tailored IAM solution. | Often bundled with Microsoft 365, making it cost-effective for existing Microsoft users |

### Best Use Cases
- **Use Okta if:** You need a cloud-agnostic IAM solution with deep third-party integrations.
- **Use Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) if:** Your business is heavily invested in Microsoft services and Windows infrastructure.
