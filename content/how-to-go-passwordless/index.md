# Transitioning to Passwordless Authentication
An in-depth guide on moving away from traditional passwords to enhance security and user experience. 

## Understanding Passwordless Login
This section goes over what passwordless login is and some of the benefits of going passwordless. 

### What is Passwordless Login
**Passwordless login** &mdash; any login mechanism that does not involve using a password to authenticate users. Examples include biometric authentication, magic links, OTPs, hardware tokens, and PKI.

### Benefits of Passwordless Login
* improved security 
* reduced phishing risks 
* enhanced user convenience &mdash as a user this is by far my favorite benefit. Every time I get excited about seeing a cool new app and see I don't need to set up a new password it feels like a little birthday gift.

## Common Passwordless Authentication Methods 
Let's go more in-depth of some of the most common passworldess authentication methods we mentioned earlier. 

### Biometric Authentication 
Utilizing fingerprints, facial recognition, or retinal scans for user verification

### One-Time Passcodes (OTP)
Codes sent via SMS or email for single-use authentication

### Magic Links
Unique links sent to a user's email that grant access when clicked. 

### Hardware Tokens
Physical devices generating time-based codes for authentication 

### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
leveraging cryptographic key pairs for secure authentication 

## Implementing SSH Passwordless login 
A step-by-step guide to setting up SSH passwordless login using public-private key pairs. 

1. Generate SSH Key Pair
    - Create a public and private key pair on the client machine. 
2. Create SSH Directory on Server
    - Ensure the `.ssh` directory exists on the remote server 
3. Upload Public Key to Server
    - Add the public key to the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file
4. Set Appropriate Permissions
    - Adjust file permissions to secure the `.ssh` directory and `authorized_keys` file.
5. Test the Connection
    - Verify that the SSH connection no longer requires a password. 

## Exploring SuperTokens for Passwordless Authentication
