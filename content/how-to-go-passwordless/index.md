# Transitioning to Passwordless Authentication
If you're thinking, "Oh great, another article telling me how terrible passwords are...üòí" &mdash; well, you're not wrong. That's definitely part of it.

But don't worry, we're not here *just* to complain‚Äîwe‚Äôre here to help you break free from the password struggle once and for all.

Let's dive in! üöÄ 

This guide will walk you through ditching traditional passwords for good, boosting both security and user experience.

Whether it‚Äôs **logging into your accounts**, **securing your infrastructure with SSH passwordless authentication**, or **streamlining access across devices**, we‚Äôll cover practical ways to make passwords a thing of the past.

## Understanding Passwordless Login

### What *is* Passwordless Login
**Passwordless login** &mdash; It's pretty simple really, nothing fancy. Passwordless login is any login mechanism that does not involve using a password to authenticate users. Examples include biometric authentication, magic links, OTPs, hardware tokens, and PKI. 

### Benefits of Passwordless Login
* **Improved security** &mdash; Passwordless authentication eliminates the risk of weak or reused passwords, making it much harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access. By relying on cryptographic keys or biometrics, it significantly reduces common vulnerabilities.
* **Reduced phishing risks** &mdash; Since there‚Äôs no password to steal, phishing attacks become far less effective. Even if an attacker tries to trick you into revealing login details, there‚Äôs simply nothing for them to capture.
* **Enhanced user convenience** &mdash; As a user, this is hands down my favorite perk. Every time I come across an exciting new app and realize I don‚Äôt have to set up yet another password, it feels like a little birthday present. üéÅ
* **Reduced IT costs** &mdash; Passwords are expensive because users forget them and businesses need to store and maintain password databases. According to a [**survey conducted by NordPass**](https://nordpass.com/blog/how-many-passwords-does-average-person-have/), the average person has more than 160 passwords. Just for fun, I checked my own password manager to see how many I have &mdash; I have 442 passwords ü§Ø. I have no idea how that happened.
* **Scalability** &mdash;

### Drawbacks of Passwordless Login and How to Overcome Them
Life is all about balance &mdash; and passwordless login is no exception. While ditching passwords sounds like a dream, it‚Äôs not all sunshine and seamless logins. Before making the switch, it‚Äôs worth knowing the potential pitfalls so you can keep your authentication as secure as possible. üîí‚ú®

* **Training and expertise needed** &mdash; 
* **Single point of failure** &mdash; 

## Common Passwordless Authentication Methods 
Let's go more in-depth of some of the most common passworldess authentication methods we mentioned earlier. 

### Biometric Authentication 
Utilizing fingerprints, facial recognition, or retinal scans for user verification

### One-Time Passcodes (OTP)
Codes sent via SMS or email for single-use authentication

### Magic Links
Unique links sent to a user's email that grant access when clicked. 

### Hardware Tokens
Physical devices generating time-based codes for authentication 

### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
leveraging cryptographic key pairs for secure authentication 

## Implementing SSH Passwordless login üîë

SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows users to securely access a computer over an unsecured network.

How are the public and private keys in SSH related? 

A step-by-step guide to setting up SSH passwordless login using public-private key pairs. 

1. Generate SSH Key Pair
    - Create a public and private key pair on the client machine. 
2. Create SSH Directory on Server
    - Ensure the `.ssh` directory exists on the remote server 
3. Upload Public Key to Server
    - Add the public key to the server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file
4. Set Appropriate Permissions
    - Adjust file permissions to secure the `.ssh` directory and `authorized_keys` file.
5. Test the Connection
    - Verify that the SSH connection no longer requires a password.

## Best Practices for Adopting Passwordless Authentication 
1. **User Education** &mdash; Inform users about the new authentication method and its benefits. 
2. **Fallback mechanism** &mdash; Provide alternative authentication methods in case of issues. 
3. **Regular Audits** &mdash; Conduct periodic security assessments of the authentication system. 
4. **Compliance** &mdash; Ensure adherence to relevant regulations and standards.
