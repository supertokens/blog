What a week! We spent some time announcing a bunch of new features and improvements at SuperTokens, making auth easier to work with for everyone.
With launch week 1 behind us, let's take a look at everything we've announced.

## Day 1: SuperTokens Extensions - Product -> Platform

SuperTokens has always been flexible. Need to override a function? Go ahead. Want to tweak a recipe? Dive into the config. But as teams scale and customizations pile up, this model breaks down fast. Logic gets tangled inside initialization files. Sharing overrides becomes impossible. And worse, you end up re-implementing the same tweaks across projects.

We asked ourselves: what if customizations could be modular, shareable, and cleanly separated?

That’s what Extensions aim to solve. Find out more about Extensions in our [blog post](https://supertokens.com/blog/supertokens-extensions/).

## Day 2: New onboarding + CLI overhaul

We rebuilt the entire onboarding journey from the ground up. The new experience introduces a guided wizard that intuitively walks you through configuration steps. Now, you can easily pick your frontend framework, backend language, and desired authentication methods. Once done, you get a ready-to-run application tailored precisely to your tech stack. You can download it, run it, and go live with authentication in record time. More on our new onboarding experience [here](https://supertokens.com/blog/revamping-onboarding).

One of the key parts of this new onboarding experience is our new CLI. We turned it into a consistent experience regardless of your tech preferences. More on our new CLI [here](https://supertokens.com/blog/cli-overhaul).

## Day 3: The SuperTokens AI Toolkit

We have been actively using AI tools in our day-to-day workflow at SuperTokens. It’s now part of the way we prototype features, debug issues, and even how we manage parts of our authentication infrastructure. Through this hands-on experience, we saw the need for a more native, flexible way to integrate authentication systems with AI workflows. That’s where our MCP Toolkit comes in. More on our MCP Toolkit [here](https://supertokens.com/blog/supertokens-mcp-toolkit).

## Day 4: Passkeys and WebAuthn

Passwords are so 2010!

The problem with passwords isn't just that users forget them (though they do). It's that they reuse weak ones ('password123' anyone?), they get breached constantly, and they're a nightmare to type on mobile. Meanwhile, your phone already knows it's you. Your laptop has a fingerprint reader sitting there unused.

That's why we've made passkeys and WebAuthn a one-liner to integrate. All for free. Details [here](https://supertokens.com/docs/authentication/passkeys/introduction).

## Day 5: Docs overhaul

It’s easy to say "your product is as good as your documentation," but it's harder to admit when yours isn't cutting it.

What started as a smart idea - personalizing the docs for different auth methods - ended up creating a maze. We optimized for features, not for the developer's journey, resulting in navigation chaos and users spending more time hunting for information than actually implementing auth.

So we did something that sounds a bit crazy: we built and tested two completely different documentation architectures. For months. We tracked how real users navigated each version, comparing the data to our assumptions. It was a rigorous, data-driven A/B test for our entire information structure.

## The bigger picture

Launch Week, with its focused daily releases, really highlights SuperTokens' core mission: making authentication simpler to integrate and bringing the solution directly to you, the developer, instead of making you adapt to the tool. The ultimate goal? Get you to working auth faster so you can focus on the truly interesting and innovative parts of your applications.

The journey of making authentication better for developers is, as always, ongoing. Team SuperTokens is actively encouraging you to explore these newly launched features, dive into the comprehensive documentation, and, most importantly, give us your feedback. Your ideas are important, because we're building this for you, and your input directly shapes SuperTokens' evolution.
