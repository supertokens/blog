## Introduction

Authentication is the cornerstone of any secure application, and for many developers, **NextAuth** has been a go-to solution. Its ease of use and compatibility with Next.js make it a strong option for basic authentication needs. However, developers often encounter limitations with NextAuth, such as restricted customization, complex multi-platform integration, and insufficient support for advanced authentication protocols.

This article explores 7 powerful alternatives to NextAuth, providing a detailed breakdown of their features, pricing, limitations, and use cases to help you choose the right solution for your project.

## Common NextAuth Challenges

While NextAuth has its merits, it may not fit every project. Let’s examine its common limitations:

1. **Limited Customization**: NextAuth is designed to be simple, which can be a double-edged sword. Customizing authentication flows, adding advanced features like multi-factor authentication (MFA), or tweaking user interfaces often proves difficult.
2. **Complex Multi-Platform Integration**: Applications requiring integration across platforms—web, mobile, and desktop—may find NextAuth’s approach insufficiently flexible.
3. **Limited Advanced Protocol Support**: While adequate for standard OAuth2.0 use cases, NextAuth struggles with more advanced or custom protocols, such as SAML or OpenID Connect extensions.

These challenges lead developers to explore more versatile and feature-rich authentication tools.
