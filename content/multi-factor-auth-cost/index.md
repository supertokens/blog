Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is no longer optionalâ€”it's a foundational security measure for any digital application. However, its implementation involves various costs that organizations must understand to make informed decisions.

In this blog, we break down the direct and hidden costs of MFA, compare leading solutions, and show why SuperTokens is a superior, cost-effective alternative.

## What is MFA?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requires users to verify their identity using two or more factors:
- **Something they know** (e.g., password)
- **Something they have** (e.g., mobile device, hardware key)
- **Something they are** (e.g., biometric identifiers)

Learn more about [real-world examples of MFA](https://supertokens.com/blog/multi-factor-authentication-examples).

## Why is MFA Crucial for Securing Digital Assets?

With credential breaches rising, relying solely on passwords is insufficient. MFA provides layered protection, significantly reducing the risk of account compromise.

**Key Insight:** According to Microsoft, MFA blocks **99.9%** of account hacks.

## An Overview of the Factors That Influence MFA Costs

Implementing MFA involves more than just licensing fees. Costs vary based on:
- Solution type (cloud vs. self-hosted)
- Licensing and usage models
- Integration and maintenance overheads
- Hardware or third-party service needs
- User training and support impacts

## Key Cost Components of MFA

### Licensing and Subscription Fees

MFA pricing models include:
- **Per-user fees:** Typically $3â€“$5/month/user (e.g., Duo, Okta)
- **Flat rates:** Often for small teams
- **Tiered pricing:** Costs escalate with feature needs

SuperTokens offers [free MFA during development](https://supertokens.com/docs/guides/mfa) and flexible production plans.

### Infrastructure and Hardware

Implementation may involve:
- **Hardware tokens:** YubiKeys (~$45â€“$60 per device)
- **Biometric scanners:** Upwards of $200 each

Cloud-hosted solutions introduce recurring fees, while self-hosted ones require infrastructure investment.

### Integration Costs

Significant engineering effort may be needed to:
- Customize MFA workflows
- Maintain a seamless UX across platforms

SuperTokens offers [pre-built, customizable UI components](https://supertokens.com/docs/guides/thirdpartyemailpassword/adding-mfa), reducing integration timelines dramatically.

### Maintenance and Support

Ongoing support costs include:
- Infrastructure upkeep
- Software updates
- Handling user issues like lost devices or backup method setup

SuperTokens' low-maintenance architecture helps keep these costs predictable. SuperTokens also has a number of cost-effective paid support plans depending on the amount of expertise required for the integration. 

### User Experience and Training

Poor MFA implementation can:
- Increase helpdesk tickets
- Cause user frustration and drop-off
- Security Vulnerabilities

- SMS OTP

Unlike most vendors, SuperTokens lets you implement SMS/email OTP without relying on costly third-party gateways.

### Tenant-Level MFA Configurations

For B2B SaaS companies, tenant-specific MFA policies can be configured easilyâ€”optimizing costs and improving security at scale.

## Hidden Costs of Not Using MFA

### Breach Recovery Costs

Recovering from a breach can cost millions in:
- Fines and lawsuits
- PR damage
- Customer churn

### Compliance Penalties

Regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS mandate MFA in many cases. Non-compliance leads to steep penalties.
